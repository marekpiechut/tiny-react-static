**Tiny React Static is a simple af... static site generator for React.**

This project was born from my love for simple things and due to original [React-Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static)
being shut down. I personally see all other alternatives as super-complex tools solving problems nobody except huge companies really has.
I just want to build my landing page. Don't want no bundle splitting, data prefetching, GQL integration and gazillion of plugins.

Along with that I'll try to bring my other idea to life - **THE Unbundling™️**.

I just think we don't need bundle splitting, dependency deduplication, bundle minimizers and all this junk.
Web was fine before that.

You don't need to bundle and re-download Lo-Dash 75 times every day, because every page is bundling it.
Maybe we can just use public CDNs? Let's not be silly, you'd already have all 3 latest versions
of Lo-Dash downloaded in your browser cache. We just need to use boring technologies from the 90'.

Who knows, maybe browsers could then cache bytecode for Lo-Dash and make all our code faster to run...

So the idea is to:
- **be small and fast**
- **require no configuration**
- **add functionality with plain JS and React, not fancy plugins**
- **Unbundling™️ - don't bundle imported libraries, use public CDNs**
